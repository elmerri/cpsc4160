2D Game Engine

This is the game I wrote for Dr. Brian Malloy's CPSC 4160 course at Clemson University.

In the game, the player controls a little penguin. The goal of the game is to collect as many
fish as you can with 3 lives and avoid the snowball that rolls back and forth. The player can
shoot at the snowball with smaller snowballs in order to dodge it. Once the player loses all
3 lives, they can either quit the game or restart.

The game also includes God Mode as a feature, and incorporates both night and day appearances
with background music to match. The heads-up display includes instructions for controls and
important keys in the game, and can be toggled on and off with F1.
